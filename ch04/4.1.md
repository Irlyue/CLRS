## 4.1-2
Brute force code for maximum subarray, [here](find_maximum_subarray.cpp), the runtime complexity is $O(n^2)$.

## 4.1-4
If empty subarray is allowed, an extra checking is needed to decide whether the sum of the returned subarray is small than 0. If it does, than drop the solution and return empty subarray.

> This requires the least amount of code changing.

## 4.1-5
Code [findMaximumSubarrayLinear](find_maximum_subarray.cpp), the runtime complexity is $O(n)$. The idea is to maintain the maximum subarray up to element k. Denote the sum of the maximum subarray that ends at k as $S[k]$. 
- If $S[k-1]$ > 0, than $S_k = S[k-1] + A[k]$;
- else, than we start over from element $k$, so $S[k] = A[k]$.

Than the maximum sum is $S=\max_{k=1}^n S[k]$.



> One funny thing, the brute force version on my computer runs around 70 seconds with an input size of  1e5. This is pretty slow. So I try to turn on the optimization flags of the compiler (I'm using cl and /O2), the runtime drops down to around 4 seconds, which really blows my mind. :happy:
